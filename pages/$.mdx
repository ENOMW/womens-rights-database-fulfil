Welcome to the first EU case-law database on the fundamental rights of migrant women. This database was created as part of the FULFIL [project](/about/project), coordinated by the [European Network of Migrant Women (ENoMW)](https://www.migrantwomennetwork.org/), in partnership with Associaçao Contra o Femicidio (Portugal), [Olympe association](https://association-olympe.fr/) (France), [IROKO](https://www.associazioneiroko.org/) (Italy), Parolin firm (Italy), [European Women Lawyers Association - EWLA](https://www.ewla.org/) (EU-wide) and with the support of the European Union (EU).

The FULFIL database is a depository of legal cases, in EU member states and at EU level (EU Court of Justice), related to the fundamental rights of migrant women on EU soil. The main aim of this database is to collect and systematise cases of actual and alleged breaches of migrant women’s fundamental rights in the EU, and highlight the use of the European Union’s [Charter of Fundamental Rights](https://commission.europa.eu/aid-development-cooperation-fundamental-rights/your-rights-eu/eu-charter-fundamental-rights_en) in such cases.

In addition, the FULFIL project and database aim to promote a [women’s rights perspective](https://www.migrantwomennetwork.org/2024/05/16/womens-rights-perspective-on-the-eu-charter-of-fundamental-rights/) on the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, departing from the traditional “gender blind” or “gender neutral” perspective, in order to better address the specific situations of migrant women and girls. By doing so, the FULFIL database aims to support legal practitioners, civil society organisations, and migrant women themselves, in their mission to fulfil, protect and promote the fundamental rights of migrant women in the EU.

The database takes a broad definition of “migrant”, covering the cases of Third Country Nationals (TCN) who arrived to the EU (e.g. those seeking international protection, those who arrived for family unification, work, studies, etc.), as well as EU citizens who migrated within the EU borders.

This database is live and is being regularly updated with new cases. If you wish to submit a case that falls within the scope of the database, please use this form:
