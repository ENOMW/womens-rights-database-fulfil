    The [European Network of Migrant
    Women](https://www.migrantwomennetwork.org/) is a migrant-women-led,
    secular, non-partisan women’s rights platform that advocates for the rights,
    freedoms and dignity of migrant, refugee and ethnic minority women and girls
    in Europe. Our diverse membership includes women from almost all the regions
    of the globe and extends to over 50 grassroots and advocacy groups in over
    23 European countries. Established in 2012, European Network of Migrant
    Women works through collaborative actions with our members – organisations,
    groups and individual migrant feminists – promoting capacity-building,
    access to rights and justice and self-representation among migrant and
    refugee women at the European and international level. Collectively, we
    foster a safe-space where girls and women of diverse ethnic and cultural
    backgrounds can come together to support each other, forge alliances and
    build solidarity across differences and borders.
