## European Network of Migrant Women, coordinator of the FULFIL project
The European Network of Migrant Women is a migrant-women-led, secular, non-partisan women’s rights platform that advocates for the rights, freedoms and dignity of migrant, refugee and ethnic minority women and girls in Europe. Our diverse membership includes women from almost all the regions of the globe and extends to over 50 grassroots and advocacy groups in over 23 European countries. Established in 2012, European Network of Migrant Women works through collaborative actions with our members – organisations, groups and individual migrant feminists – promoting capacity-building, access to rights and justice and self-representation among migrant and refugee women at the European and international level. Collectively, we foster a safe-space where girls and women of diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds can come together to support each other, forge alliances and build solidarity across differences and borders.

## European Women Lawyers Association, European partner of the FULFIL project

The European Women Lawyers Association is constituted and incorporated as a non-profit international non-governmental organization having philanthropic, scientific and pedagogical aims. EWLA is a federation of national women lawyers associations within EU, EEA and EFTA, as well as individual women lawyers and academics from these countries. EWLA pursues the co-operation of European women lawyers, in order to combine their specific expertise in fundamental rights, and in particular, gender equality

The aims of EWLA are:

- to improve the understanding of European legislation in relation to equality, with particular reference to women, and its effects;
- to bring together women lawyers across the European Union, e.g. by the closest possible contacts with bars, law societies, associations of women lawyers, faculties and schools of legal education and research, both on a national and international level and with European or other public authorities;
- to undertake studies, research and conferences of European women lawyers also with organizations and institutions inside and outside of Europe with view to achieving equality of rights and opportunities;
- to strengthen links between EU women lawyers and to encourage meetings, cooperation and unterstanding between women lawyers.

Women’s interests in the institutions of the European Union in all women’s issues in general and in the legal field in particular are represented and defended without prejudice to the scientific and pedagogical principal character of EWLA.
