The FULFIL (Fostering Understanding and Legal Integration through Fundamental Rights Litigation) project is an EU-wide initiative coordinated by the European Network of Migrant Women, aimed at enhancing the capabilities of legal professionals and organisations in supporting migrant women's rights. By providing training, resources, and advocacy, the project seeks to strengthen the protection of migrant women's fundamental rights across Europe. Project partners are:
- Associação Contra o Femicidio (Portugal)
- Olympe association (France)
- IROKO (Italy)
- Parolin firm (Italy)
- European Women Lawyers Association - EWLA (EU-wide)

The FULFIL project carried out in 2022 - 2024 was built from the understanding that legal professionals across the EU lack capacity and knowledge to effectively use the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights in cases of migrant women’s fundamental rights violations.

The project tackled this phenomenon through:

- The building of a new legal and sociological analytical framework on the EU Charter of Fundamental rights, encompassing a women’s rights perspective, to promote a shift in legal culture, moving from the traditional “gender-blind” perspective to better account for the specific situations of migrant women.

- The design and implementation of a comprehensive training program tailored to the needs of legal professionals, as well as specific modules for Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) and professionals working with migrant women, and migrant women themselves. In 2024, 600 legal professionals (lawyers, judges, jurists, diplomats, law enforcement officials, etc.), 100 migrant women and 50 CSOs across the European Union followed the FULFIL training program, gaining knowledge and skills in support, intervention, and litigation, at the national and EU level, in cases of breaches of the fundamental rights of migrant women.

- The creation of the first EU database on migrant women’s fundamental rights violations.
