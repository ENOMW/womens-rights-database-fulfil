# Submit a Case for the Database
Welcome to our page dedicated to submitting cases for our database. This initiative aims to collect and centralise information on case-law related to violations of the fundamental rights of migrant women within the European Union. We invite you to share relevant cases that can enrich this database and contribute to a better understanding and protection of migrant women's rights.

## Why submit a case?

Collecting this information is crucial for several reasons:

- **Contributing to legal research and analysis**: By submitting cases, you help researchers, lawyers, non-governmental organisations, and policymakers gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics of fundamental rights violations faced by migrant women in the EU.
- **Promoting justice**: Each submitted case can potentially serve as a reference for similar cases, providing a solid legal foundation to defend the rights of migrant women.

## How to submit a case?

You can submit a case through this form:

The submission process is simple, quick and flexible. You can submit cases from different jurisdictions (national jurisdictions from European countries, EU jurisdictions, or European jurisdictions). We understand that some information may be complicated to access or sensitive, which is why **all responses are optional**. You are encouraged to provide as much detail as possible, but we also welcome shorter submissions.
Thank you for your participation and your commitment to defending the rights of migrant women. If you have any questions or need assistance with submitting a case, please do not hesitate to contact us at info@migrantwomennetwork.org.
